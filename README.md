# Customer-Segmentation_1
This project uses K-Means clustering to divide customers into meaningful groups based on age, income, and spending behavior. I performed data preprocessing, feature scaling, and cluster validation using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score. The results were visualized and deployed as a Streamlit web application for interactive analysis.
